# Morning Routine

Every morning, Mai wakes up at six o'clock. She stretches, opens the window, and greets the new day with a smile. After brushing her teeth, she makes a cup of warm tea for her mother.

At half past six, Mai has breakfast with her family. They usually eat rice, eggs, and fresh vegetables. Mai enjoys talking with her parents about the plan for the day.

Before leaving for school, she checks her backpack carefully. She always brings a bottle of water, a notebook, and her favorite blue pen. Walking to school helps her feel relaxed and ready to learn.
